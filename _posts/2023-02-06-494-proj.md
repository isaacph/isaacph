# Legend of Zelda

Hello, for EECS 494 at the University of Michigan, I was tasked to create a replica of the original Legend of Zelda for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).
Here is a link to the download: <a href="https://isaac-huffman.itch.io/494-legend-of-zelda-clone">Click here</a>


This game has to mimick the original pretty faithfully, but also include an extra mechanic and a bonus level. For my extra mechanic, I chose to make a flamethrower and meltable blocks.
The extra level is a harder level that thoroughly utilizes these mechanics in interesting ways.
