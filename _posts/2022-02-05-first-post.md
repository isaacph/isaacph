# Welcome

Hello readers. This is the beginning of my blog. I am writing this blog to complete the WolverineSoft Studio MDP assignment. I am planning bi-weekly blog posts documenting my completion of Studio tasks.
In order to complete my first task, creation of this blog, I chose to use Jekyll and GitHub pages. These were suprisingly easy to set up. I am currently writing this blog post in Vim in i3wm on Linux. Here is an image of my setup (time to learn to add images to a post).

That's all for now. Next post is probably next week.
