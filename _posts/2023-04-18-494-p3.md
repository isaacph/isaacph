# Metallurgy

Hello, for EECS 494 at the University of Michigan, I joined a team of 4 others to create a new game over six weeks.
The concept we decided on was a 2D action platformer rogue-like with procedural generation. This game is almost entirely focused on fighting, with few or no puzzles
and lots of enemies to defeat.

In this game, I contributed to almost every part of development. I wrote the procedural generation framework, from which a team member wrote specific rooms. I drew the wisp enemies
and the second minotaur boss' special wave effects. I also designed most of the special looking rooms, primarily being the boss rooms. I also scripted in audio, scripted the minotaurs,
scripted player movement, worked a lot on combat and weapons, and some more too.
